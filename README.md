# Assignment-2
#Task 1
: My task 1 is a code to determine if the given number is even or odd. For this purpose I take the number as input, then checks the number using if else statement.
I  divide the number by 2. If the remainder is zero number is even. If remainder is not zero then it is odd.

#Task2
: In my task to I calculated the numbers from 1 to 10. For that purpose I used for loop with range operation.
I took a initial variable 'b' also which had value 0. The principal is the loop variable will take each from the range and then add with b and then the calcuated value will be replaced by old value.
by doing this, at the end of 50 th term, all the values will be added together.
